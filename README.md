# Stochastic Models in Biology

Dr. JosiÄ‡ and Dr. Stewart taught a class on Stochastic Models in Biology in Fall 2020 at the University of Houston.

The grades for the class were based on the performance on individual homework and group computational challenges. Here, we provide all the homework and computational challenges assigned, as well as detailed solutions to all four versions of computational challenges 4 and 9. As an example, folder 4.1 contains to version 1 of computational challenge 4. All the code was written in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. 

# How to Contribute to this repository?

We welcome suggestions for further challenges. 

The submissions should clearly illustrate a concept in the theory of stochastic processes
in the context a concrete biological problem. Moreover, the programming challenge should:

1. have a solution that offers insight into the behavior of a real biological system
2. have a solution that can be arrived at and implemented within 10 hours by an average programmer; and
3. have identifiable limiting and test cases where the system's behavior can be predicted either intuitively, or using straightforward analysis.
