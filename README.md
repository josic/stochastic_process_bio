## Stochastic Models in Biology

Dr. JosiÄ‡ and Dr. Stewart taught a class on Stochastic Models in Biology in Fall 2020 at the University of Houston.

The grades for the class were based on the performance on individual homework and group computational challenges. Here, we provide all the homework and computational challenges assigned, as well as detailed solutions to all four versions of computational challenges 4 and 9. As an example, folder 4.1 contains to version 1 of computational challenge 4. All the code was written in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.
